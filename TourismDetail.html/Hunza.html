Many people came to Hunza just to get a few glimpses of the shining ice wall of the Rakaposhi Mountain. Other popular mountains in Hunza include Passu Peak, Ultra Peak, and Kuksel Sar. </figcaption><br/>

            Hunza was an independent principality for centuries. It was ruled by the Mirs of Hunza, who took the title of Thum.

            The Hunzai's were tributaries and allies to China, acknowledging China as suzerain since 1760[3] or 1761.[4][5] Hunza rulers claimed descent from Alexander the Great, and viewed themselves and the Emperor of China as being the most important leaders in the world.[6] When the Kanjutis (people of Hunza) raided mountainous places of Karakorum and Kunlun mountains, including Xaidulla, where some groups of the nomadic Kirghiz were the main inhabitants, they sold some Kirghiz slaves to the Chinese.[7]
            
            From 1847 the Mir of Hunza gave nominal allegiance to China. This resulted from assistance given by Mir Ghazanfur Khan to China in fighting against the Uyghur separatist Afaqi Khoja revolts in Yarkand, following which China granted Hunza a jagir (Land grant) in Yarkand and paid the Mir a subsidy.[8][9] In 1860, the ruler of Hunza paid tribute to the Dogras after their conquest of Gilgit, and Hunza became a tributary to both Kashmir and China.[3] The last fully independent ruler, Mir Safdar Khan, who ruled from 1886, escaped to China after an invasion by the British.[6]
