        <p>Throughout its history, Swat has been under the rule of various empires and consequently, has witnessed the rise and fall of numerous civilizations.

            Though Swat is no older than other civilizations found in Pakistan, such as Harappa and Taxila, it does date back to the times of Alexander the Great. Archaeological evidence – temples, statues, idols etc. – show strong signs of ancient Buddhism and Hinduism. According to a local travelogue, there are almost 2,200 historical sites in Swat.
            
            Swat was merged into Pakistan when it was established as a country in 1947 after the United Kingdom agreed to a partition from India. However, Swat remained an autonomous state until 1969, when it was fully integrated into the country.
            
            The territory of Swat begins at the confluence of the rivers Swat and Panjkora and is situated at an altitude of two thousand feet. Geographically, the city can be divided into two phases: Swat Kohistan, which is the mountainous area, and Swat Khas, which is further divided into two parts, Bar (upper land) and Kuz (lower land). Alongside its prominent location, the Swat Valley is full of majestic natural landscapes, icy and lofty mountains, lush and vast plains, cold breeze rising from the river Swat, gardens of fragrant flowers and delicious fruit, springs, high waterfalls, dazzling lakes, and glaciers.</p>
